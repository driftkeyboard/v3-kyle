## Drift Keyboard Choc Conversion
This is how to convert to a low-profile choc version:  

### Basically you only have to remove one layer of the outer acrylic frame  
<br/>

 - Disassemble your drift keyboard then remove all the brass standoffs  
 
 - Replace all the brass standoffs with 4mm brass standoffs  
 
 - The top screws under the keys should be changed to 4mm M2 screws if they are not already that length.  
 
 - You will need to use the [Choc Plate](https://github.com/Timception/3d-printables/tree/main/v3/plates) which slightly different from the MX switch plate.

### This is what your Drift Keyboard should look like after the conversion:

Only one layer of outer acrylic beneath the pcb, and the plate is now sandwiched flush with the pcb.
